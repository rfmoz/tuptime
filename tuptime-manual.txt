============
| Abstract |
============

Tuptime report historical and statistical real time of the system, keeping it between restarts.
Indeed, it can:

  - Count system startups
  - Register first boot time (since installation time)
  - Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns 
  - Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
  - Accumulated system uptime (running and sleeping), downtime and total
  - Register used kernels and boot IDs
  - Report current uptime
  - Print formatted table or list with the system history
  - Narrow reports since, until or at a given startup or timestamp
  - Output in csv format



=================
| Prerequisites |
=================

Operating systems:
   - Linux
   - BSD

Software:
   - Python 3.x
   - Python modules (most included in python core by default):
       sys, os, argparse, locale, platform, signal, logging, sqlite3, datetime

If a distro is used, all is met with:
    - In Linux:  'python' package >= 3.0
    - In FreeBSD: 'python3' and 'py36-sqlite3'



================
| Installation |
================

For Linux systems:

   + From distribution repository:

       Debian  - https://packages.debian.org/tuptime

       Ubuntu  - https://packages.ubuntu.com/tuptime

       Arch    - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuptime/

       Fedora, CentOS  - https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/frankcrawford/tuptime/


   + Using bash script:
      
       Download and execute the installation script:

           # bash <(curl -Ls https://git.io/tuptime-install.sh)

   + Manual install:

       Clone repository and copy executable file:

           # install -m 755 tuptime/src/tuptime /usr/bin/tuptime

       Add _tuptime user:

           # useradd --system --no-create-home --home-dir '/var/lib/tuptime' \
             --shell '/bin/false' --comment 'Tuptime execution user' _tuptime

       Execute tuptime with a privilege user for create DB path:

           # tuptime

       Change owner of the DB path and file:

           # chown -R _tuptime:_tuptime /var/lib/tuptime

       Copy cron file:

           # install -m 644 tuptime/src/cron.d/tuptime /etc/cron.d/tuptime

       If it use systemd, copy service file and enable it:

           # install -m 644 tuptime/src/systemd/tuptime.service /lib/systemd/system/tuptime.service
           # systemctl enable tuptime.service && systemctl start tuptime.service

           (Alternative) Using systemd timer instead of cron file:

               # install -m 644 tuptime/src/systemd/tuptime-cron.* /lib/systemd/system/
               # systemctl enable tuptime-cron.timer && systemctl start tuptime-cron.timer
               # rm /etc/cron.d/tuptime

       Or if it is an old RedHat system or derivate, copy the init file:

           # install -m 755 tuptime/src/init.d/redhat/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
           # chkconfig --add tuptime && chkconfig tuptime on

       Or if it is and old Debian system or derivate, copy the init file:

           # install -m 755 tuptime/src/init.d/debian/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
           # update-rc.d tuptime defaults
           # /etc/init.d/tuptime start

       That's all, enjoy it.


For BSDs systems:

   + On FreeBSD and derivates using packages or ports:

           # pkg install tuptime
      
           (or)
       
           # /usr/ports/sysutils/tuptime

       Add the suggested cron entry and enable it on rc:

           # sysrc tuptime_enable=YES
           # service tuptime start

   + Manual install on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and derivates:

       Please, read misc/bsd-manual-install.txt


Partial support for OSX (Darwin) system:

   Tuptime is compatible with OSX, but the integration with LaunchD is not
   complete. Please, read misc/osx-notes.txt


Note about Python 2.7:

   Tuptime <= 3.5.0 can be executed with Python 2.7.
   Set the shebang line to '#!/usr/bin/env python' to get it.

         tuptime --dec 9


-f <FILE>, --filedb=<FILE>
  Define an alternative database file. Default is located in 
  '/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db'. It takes precedence over environmental variable
  'TUPTIME_DBF'.

  Examples:
         tuptime -f /var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db  # (Default)
         tuptime -f /tmp/test1.db
         tuptime --filedb /tmp/test2.db

  
-g, --graceful
  Register the time in DB as a graceful shutdown. This option is the way that
  tuptime have for know if is a good or a bad shutdown. This is used in the 
  init.d and systemd files at the shutdown process.

  Examples:
         tuptime -g
         tuptime --graceful


-i, --invert
  Print startup number in reverse count starting since last boot. Only works in
  conjunction with (-t), (-l), or (--tat) options. Equal than the output of

         tuptime -t -i
         tuptime -tib
         tuptime -l --invert


-k, --kernel
  Add kernel information to the output.

  Examples:

  when reporting modified DB files.

  Examples:
         tuptime -n
         tuptime --noup


-o [u|r|s|e|d|k], --order=[u|r|s|e|d|k]
  Order enumerate output from table or list by:
    <u>  uptime
    <r>  runtime
    <s>  sleep time
    <e>  end status
    <d>  downtime
    <k>  kernel
  Therefore, only works in conjunction with (-t) or (-l) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -t -o e
         tuptime -l -o k
         tuptime -t --order u
         tuptime -l --order d


-p, --power

-S <STARTUP>, --since <STARTUP>
  Limit values only from this startup number. Take it from (-t) table or
  (-l) list reports. Negative values allowed.

  Examples:
          tuptime -S 34
          tuptime --since 22
          tuptime -l -S -10

  Examples:
         tuptime -t
         tuptime --table


--tat
  Report system status at specific timestamp, register number enclosed and time
  elapsed and remaining in that matched status.

  Examples:
         tuptime --tat 1555280149
         tuptime --tat `date -d "1 day ago" +%s`
         tuptime -cs --tat 1555281311


--tsince <TIMESTAMP>
  Limit report from the given epoch timestamp. Negative values allowed.
  Options (-S) and (-U) have precedence over this one.

  Examples:
         tuptime --tsince 1454998872

         tuptime --tuntil -2592000  # Until one month ago


-U <STARTUP>, --until <STARTUP>
  Limit values only up until this startup number. Take it from (-t) table or
  (-l) list reports. Negative values allowed.

  Examples:
          tuptime -U 45
          tuptime --until 11
          tuptime -l -U -10


-v, --verbose
  Print information about the internals of tuptime. It's good for debugging 
  how it gets the variables.

  Examples:
         tuptime -v
         tuptime --verbose


-V, --version:
  Print version number and exit.

  Examples:
         tuptime -V
         tuptime --version


-x, --silent
  Any output is printed. Only update values and save them into disk.

  Examples:
         tuptime -x
         tuptime --silent



=========================
| Environment variables |
=========================

List of supported environmental variables:

TUPTIME_DBF
  Set an alternative database file path. The argument -f, --filedb takes
  precedence over this.

  Example for ksh / sh / bash:
         export TUPTIME_DBF="/opt/tuptime.db"

  Example for csh / tcsh:
         setenv TUPTIME_DBF /opt/tuptime.db 

  Example for systemd unit:
         Environment="TUPTIME_DBF='/opt/tuptime.db'"



======================
| Schedule execution |
======================

It's important to have a schedule execution. If the init or systemd scripts
are installed as it needs, the program only update values at startup and 
shutdown, but if the system fails, hangs or whatever, the uptime time will
be lost. Be sure that the cron entry or, in other case, the systemd
tuptime-cron.[timer|service] units are installed as expected.

Why it's needed the use of an other .service file with the name tuptime-cron?
The default tuptime.service file uses the option 'RemainAfterExit=true' and
nowadays the systemd timer can't restart an already running service, so, this
is the best workaround.

By default, both have a 5 minutes scheduled execution. Feel free to lower 
that value if your requirements are narrow.



==================
| Default output |
==================

System startups:
 Total number of system startups registered since first timestamp available.

System shutdowns:
  Total number of shutdowns done correctly or incorrectly.

System life:
  Time counter since first startup timestamp available.

System uptime:
System downtime:
  Percentage of time and time counter.

Average uptime:
Average downtime: 
  Time counter with the average time.

Current uptime:
  Actual time counter and datetime since registered boot timestamp.


Removed on version 5 and equivalent output:

  Largest uptime:      tuptime -tor u | head -3
  Shortest uptime:     tuptime -to u | head -3
  Largest downtime:    tuptime -tor d | head -3
  Shortest downtime:   tuptime -to d | head -3



======================================
| DB format changes between versions |
======================================

From 2.x to 3.x:
    From 2.x to 3.0, reorder columns, added offbtime, endst and downtime. From 3.0 to 3.1,
    added kernel column. The migration scripts are loated at:
    
    https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/misc/cripts/db-tuptime-migrate-2.0-to-3.0.sh
    https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/misc/cripts/db-tuptime-migrate-3.0-to-3.1.sh
 
From 3.x to 4.x:
    Added rntime and slptime registers, also uptime, rntime, slptime, downtime are now integers.
    The migrations is done automatically from Tuptime. Also, the migration script
    is located at:

    https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/misc/cripts/db-tuptime-migrate-3.1-to-4.0.sh
 
From 4.x to 5.x:
    Added bootid register. The migrations is done automatically from Tuptime.
    Also, the migration script is located at:

    https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/misc/cripts/db-tuptime-migrate-4.0-to-5.0.sh


==================
| Database Specs |
==================

Tuptime use a sqlite3 database located in '/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db' with
the following format:

tuptime (bootid text,
         btime integer,
         uptime integer,
         rntime integer,
         slptime integer,
         offbtime integer,
         endst integer,
         downtime integer,
         kernel text)

bootid   Unique boot identifier (if it exists)
btime    Startup timestamp in epoch
uptime   Uptime seconds  
rntime   Running time seconds
slptime  Sleeping time seconds
offbtime Shutdown timestamp in epoch
endst    Type of shutdown [1 ok | 0 bad]
downtime Downtime seconds
kernel   Name of the kernel

The number of startup sequency is extracted from 'rowid', the signed integer 
key that uniquely identifies the row within its table in sqlite.

For reset all the values, simply delete the database file.

It is possible to query and modify it directly, but it's better to use any of
the scripts located under 'misc/scripts' for modify, join or check it.

If a complete row is deleted and the database is not recreate completely (vacuum),
rowid keep the real information about startup number. Tuptime will advert about
it if the verbose mode is enabled.



============================
| About sync date and time |
============================

Large jumps over the date and time in a system can cause problems, especially
when the uptime value is low.

Take care of the hardware clock RTC (if the system have), or how the operating
system initializes their clock at startup. Tuptime register the timestamp
reported by the system at first execution after boot and use it to calculate
the previous shutdown time and the current uptime value. The command 'who -b'
do more less the same.

If the system starts with a incorrect datetime and some external time sync is
used, like ntpd or timesyncd, a few time after boot the startup datetime reported
by the system may change. This behaviour is also related with adjustments
performed by adjtime(3), systems running inside virtualized environments, servers
with high load or with high disk I/O, wrong computation of jiffies / HZ and the
problema of lost ticks.

A slightly drift is compensate over the uptime value, but a very high drift can cause
abnormal registers and output, for example, Raspberry Pi don't have any clock and
initializes from 1 January 1970. A downtime of 0, when it's clear than it was
physically impossible, it's a common indicator than the clock had a large backward
sync jump.

As Tuptime have time dependency, their Systemd service unit pulls time-sync.target
and it's ordered before it. Note that it doesn't assure that the clock is synchronized,
only that it needs it. On last releases of Systemd, there is a new unit that delays
reaching time-sync.target until stay on sync 'systemd-time-wait-sync',but it isn't
enable by default nowadays.

A few recommendations / workarounds are:

Enable 'systemd-time-wait-sync'. But take care because it can delay the execution
more than expected and a startup can be lost. Check open issues on Systemd's GitHub.

Use 'systemd-timesyncd' if it is available (timedatectl set-ntp true), it can also
keep the time in systems without hardware clock. Disable any other time sync service
like 'ntp', 'chrony', 'openntpd' to avoid issues, most related with the use in
conjunction with 'systemd-time-wait-sync'.

Use any time sync service like 'ntp', 'chrony' or 'openntpd' and disable
'systemd-timesyncd'. Add the time sync service requirement on 'tuptime.service' at
the end of 'After=' and 'Wants=' lines.

Force a time sync in the 'tuptime.unit' file. Add under '[Service]' definition the 
line 'ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org'

If the systems is a single-board computer, like Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone, use a
RTC module and configure it properly.

Without Systemd, use a ntp client and delay the execution of tuptime until the time
is synced. Also, 'ntp-wait' can be added to the init script and the cron line
preceeding the tuptime execution.

Try and failure is the best way to find the right solution for the environment in 
which the system is running.

The drift value that Tuptime have reference is reported in verbose mode 'tuptime -v'
in the line 'INFO:Drift over btime'. Values around +-1 are common and can be
considered as normal.

| Date and Epoch notes |
========================

The options --tsince, --tuntil and --tat use epoch timestamp format, as quick
reference here are some notes:

Seconds equivalences:
        1 year    31536000 seconds
        1 month    2592000 seconds
        1 week      604800 seconds
        1 day        86400 seconds
        1 hour        3600 seconds

Convert human datetime to epoch:
        date -d "JAN-18-2018" +%s
        date -d "20-JAN-18" +%s
        date -d "2018-01-20 16:21:42" +%s

Convert epoch to human datetime:
        date -d "@1516748400"

Preceding conversions uses GNU date, on FreeBSD install "coreutils" and call
them with "gdate".

Tuptime can be executed with 'root' user, but it's recommendable the use of an
unprivileged user, like '_tuptime' as the installation section points to avoid
security problems. In any case, if the database file is not writable by the
current execution user, the changes are not saved. This situation is covered
for print values, but not for update database, that's why a user who can write
in the database file must execute tuptime, usually from the init manager, to
update values at startup and shutdown, at least.

Kernel name is registered each time that tuptime update values. If ksplice is
used to update the kernel, last kernel will have the whole time assignment
since the last system start.

Tuptime is backed by a SQLite database. It is highly resilient but fails can
occur in any software and hardware level, producing a database corruption. Here
is an excellent documentation about it https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.html

If a backup of the DB file is needed in other place, take a look to Litestream.
This is a streaming replication tool for SQLite databases, it works fine with
Tuptime. https://litestream.io/

The uptime reference is linked with the wall clock time elapsed since boot, not
the running effective time. Running (effective time) and hibernate power states
are childs of the uptime and report accumulated values inside their time range,
which counts since the startup until the shutdown.

If the system have configured a time zone with daylight saving time (DST),
to avoid problems when the time change, the real time clock (RTC) should have
set to universal time coordinated (UTC), not local time. Check it with 
'timedatectl' command.  Reports involving DST changes are completely right.
The system current local time zone is the reference for all timestamps printed.

The name of the tool is based on the contraction of the words Total Uptime.
