============
| Abstract |
============

Tuptime report historical and statistical running time of the system, keeping it between restarts.
Indeed, it can:

  - Count system startups
  - Register first boot time (a.k.a. installation time)
  - Count nicely and accidentally shutdowns 
  - Uptime and downtime percentage since first boot time
  - Accumulated system uptime, downtime and total
  - Largest, shortest and average uptime and downtime
  - Current uptime
  - Print formatted table or list with most of the previous values
  - Register used kernels
  - Narrow reports since and/or until a given startup or timestamp
  - Reports in csv



=================
| Prerequisites |
=================

Operating system:
   - Linux
   - FreeBSD

Software:
   - Python 3.x
   - Python modules (most included in python core by default):
       sys, os, argparse, locale, platform, signal, logging, sqlite3, datetime

If a distro is used, all is met with:
    - In Linux:  'python' package >= 3.0
    - In FreeBSD: 'python3' and 'py36-sqlite3'



================
| Installation |
================

For Linux systems:

   + From distribution repository:

      Debian  - https://packages.debian.org/tuptime

      Ubuntu  - https://packages.ubuntu.com/tuptime

      Arch    - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tuptime/

   + Using .sh script:
      
      Download and execute the installation script:

         # bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfrail3/tuptime/master/tuptime-install.sh)

   + Manual install:

      Clone repository and copy executable file:

         # install -m 755 tuptime/src/tuptime /usr/bin/tuptime

      Add tuptime user:

         # useradd --system --no-create-home --home-dir '/var/lib/tuptime' \
           --shell '/bin/false' --comment 'Tuptime execution user,,,' tuptime

      Execute tuptime with a privilege user for create db path:

         # tuptime

      Change owner of the db file:

         # chown -R tuptime:tuptime /var/lib/tuptime

      Copy cron file:

         # install -m 644 tuptime/src/cron.d/tuptime /etc/cron.d/tuptime

      If use systemd, copy service file and enable it:
	
         # install -m 644 tuptime/src/systemd/tuptime.service /lib/systemd/system/tuptime.service
         # systemctl enable tuptime.service
         # systemctl start tuptime.service

         (Alternative) Using systemd timer instead of cron file:

             # install -m 644 tuptime/src/systemd/tuptime-cron.* /lib/systemd/system/
             # systemctl enable tuptime-cron.timer
             # systemctl start tuptime-cron.timer
             # rm /etc/cron.d/tuptime

      Or if it have upstart system, copy the file:

         # install -m 755 tuptime/src/init.d/redhat/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
	 # chkconfig --add tuptime
	 # chkconfig tuptime on

      Or if it have init system, copy the file:

         # install -m 755 tuptime/src/init.d/debian/tuptime /etc/init.d/tuptime
         # update-rc.d tuptime defaults
	 # /etc/init.d/tuptime start

      That's all, enjoy it.

   + Building RPM file for RedHat, Fedora and derivates:

      Instructions and .spec file located at misc/rpm/

   + Building DEB file for Debian, Ubuntu and derivates:

      Instructions located at misc/deb/



For FreeBSD system:

   + Using FreeBSD ports

      /usr/ports/sysutils/tuptime

      Add the suggested cron entry

      Enable it in rc:

         # echo 'tuptime_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf

   + Manual install

      Clone repository and copy executable file:

         # install -m 755 tuptime/src/tuptime /usr/local/bin/tuptime

      Add tuptime user:

         # pw adduser tuptime -d /nonexistent -s /bin/sh -c "Tuptime execution user"

      Execute tuptime with a privilege user for create db path:

         # tuptime

      Change owner of the db file:

         # chown -R tuptime:tuptime /var/lib/tuptime

      Add an entry to /etc/crontab

         */3     *       *       *       *       tuptime    /usr/local/bin/tuptime -x

      Copy rc.d file:

         # install -m 555 tuptime/src/rc.d/freebsd/tuptime /usr/local/etc/rc.d/tuptime
         # echo 'tuptime_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf


Partial support for OSX (Darwin) system:

   Tuptime is compatible with OSX, it also comes with 'python' installed by
   default, but for now, the project lacks of launchd files for the startup,
   shutdown and the schedule run.


Partial support for Windows system:

   Two options are available for running Tuptime under Windows:

       + Cywin with Python3.

       + WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) with Ubuntu installed. 

   But you need to find the right way in your setup to launch the execution at 
   startup and shutdown plus the triggering from the task schedule.


Note about Python 2.7:

   Tuptime 3.3.3 can continue running over Python 2.7 if the shebang line is 
   changed to '#!/usr/bin/env python'

         tuptime -f /tmp/test1.db
         tuptime --filedb /tmp/test2.db

  
-g, --graceful
  Register the time in db as a graceful shutdown. This option is the way that
  tuptime have for know if is a good or a bad shutdown. This is used in the 
  init.d and systemd files at the shutdown process.

  Examples:
         tuptime -g
         tuptime --graceful


-k, --kernel

  end status and offtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptime -l
         tuptime --list


-n, --noup
  Avoid update values in the db with the current btime, uptime, etc. Useful 
  when reporting modified db files.

  Examples:

         tuptime -t --order u
         tuptime -l --order d


-r, --reverse
  Reverse the order for table or list output. Therefore, only works in conjunction with 
  any of (-t), (-l), (-e), (-o), (-u) and (-c) options.

  Examples:
         tuptime -tr
         tuptime -lur
         tuptime -teo --reverse
         tuptime -l --reverse


-s, --seconds
  Change default human readable date style and print times in seconds and
  dates in epoch.

  Examples:
         tuptime -s
         tuptime --seconds


-S <SINCE>, --since <SINCE>
  Restrict values only since this startup number. Take it from (-t) table or
  (-l) list reports. Negative values allowed.

  Examples:
          tuptime -S 34
          tuptime --since 22
          tuptime -l -S -10  # List since last 10 registers

  
-t, --table
  Enumerate as table each startup number, startup date, uptime, shutdown date, 
  end status and downtime. Multiple order options can be combined together.

  Examples:
         tuptime -t
         tuptime --table


--tsince <TIMESTAMP>
  Restrict report since the given epoch timestamp. Negative values allowed.
  Options (-S) and (-U) have precedence over this one.

  Examples:
         tuptime --tsince 1454998872
         tuptime --tsince -31536000  # Since one year ago


--tuntil <TIMESTAMP>
  Restrict report until the given epoch timestamp. Negative values allowed.
  Options (-S) and (-U) have precedence over this one.

  Examples:
         tuptime --tuntil 1454999619
         tuptime --tuntil -2592000  # Until one month ago


-U <UNTIL>, --until <UNTIL>
  Restrict values only until this startup number. Take it from (-t) table or
  (-l) list reports. Negative values allowed.

  Examples:
          tuptime -U 45
          tuptime --until 11
          tuptime -l -U -10  # List all except last 10 registers


-v, --verbose
  Print information about the internals of tuptime. It's good for debugging 
  how it gets the variables.

  Examples:
         tuptime -v
         tuptime --verbose


-V, --version:
  Print version number and exit.

  Examples:
         tuptime -V
         tuptime --version


-x, --silent
  Any output is printed. Only update values and save them into disk.

  Examples:
         tuptime -x
         tuptime --silent



======================
| Schedule execution |
======================

It's important to have a schedule execution. If the init or systemd scripts
are installed as it needs, the program only update values at startup and 
shutdown, but if the system fails, hangs or whatever, the uptime time will
be lost. Be sure that the cron entry or systemd tuptime-cron.[timer|service]
units are installed as expected.

By default, both have a 5 minutes scheduled execution. Feel free to lower 
that value if your requirements are narrow.



==================
| Default output |
==================

System startups:	
 Total number of system startups from since to until date. Until is joined if
 is used in a narrow range.

System shutdowns:
  Total number of shutdowns done correctly or incorrectly. The separator 
  points to the state of last shutdown (<-) ok, (->) bad if any filter is used.

System uptime:
  Percentage of uptime and time counter.

System downtime:
  Percentage of downtime and time counter.

System life:
  Time counter since first startup date until last.

Largest uptime:
Shortest uptime:
Largest downtime:
Shortest downtime:
  Time counter and date with the largest/shortest uptime register. 

Average uptime:
Average downtime: 
  Time counter with the average time.

Current uptime:
  Actual time counter and date since registered boot date.



=============================================
| DB format changes from 2.x to 3.x version |
=============================================

If this error appears:

...(a few lines)...
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: endst

or:

...(a few lines)...
    db_rows[-1][4] = opt.endst
IndexError: list assignment index out of range

Is because the database have the format of the 2.x release. For migrate it, 
please, execute the script "db-tuptime-migrate.sh" which is located at:

https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime/blob/master/misc/cripts/db-tuptime-migrate.sh
 
 

==================
| Database Specs |
==================

Tuptime use a sqlite3 database located in "/var/lib/tuptime/tuptime.db" with
the following format:

tuptime (btime integer, 
         uptime real, 
         offbtime integer, 
         endst integer, 
         downtime real, 
         kernel text)

btime    Startup date in epoch
uptime   Uptime seconds  
offbtime Shutdown date in epoch
endst    Type of shutdown [1 ok | 0 bad]
downtime Downtime seconds
kernel   Name of the kernel

The number of startup sequency is extracted from "rowid", the signed integer 
key that uniquely identifies the row within its table in sqlite.

For reset all the values, simply detele the database file.

Is it possible to query and modify it directly. But if a complete row is
deleted and the database is not recreate completely (vacuum), rowid keep the real
information about startup number. Tuptime will advert about it if the verbose
mode is enabled.



============================
| About sync date and time |
============================

Large jumps over the date and time in a system can cause problems, expecially
when the uptime value is low.

Take care of the harware clock RTC (if the system have), or how the operating
system initializes their clock at startup. Tuptime register the date reported by
the system at first execution after boot (usually from init system) and use it
to calculate the previous shutdown time and the current uptime value. The command
"who -b" do more less the same.

If the system starts with a incorrect date and time and some external time sync is
used, like ntpd or timesyncd, a few time after boot the startup date reported by
the system may change. A slightly drift is compensate over the uptime value, but a
very high drift can cause inconsistent registers and output, for example, Raspberry
Pi don't have any clock and initializes from 1 January 1970.

For avoid that problem the systemd unit have the time-sync.target requirement, but
for now it have a bug (https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5097) and not work
as expected.

Tuptime report the drift when it is executed in verbose mode "tuptime -v" in the
line "INFO:Drift over btime". Values around +-1 are very common and can be
considered as normal.

A few recomendations / workarounds are:

If the systems is a single-board computer, like Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone, use a
RTC module and configure it properly.

Use timesyncd if is available (timedatectl set-ntp true), it can also keep the time
in systems without hardware clock.

If the system dont have any RTC and the bug over time-sync isn't fixed, the use of 
"systemd-timesyncd-wait" can reach the desired behaviour and solve it. More info
in (https://github.com/assisi/systemd-timesyncd-wait)

Use the traditional ntp client and delay the execution of tuptime until the time
is synced. Add under "[Unit]" the text "ntp.service" at the end of "After=" and
"Requires=" lines.

Force a time sync in the "tuptime.unit" file. Add under "[Service]" definition the 
line "ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org"

In systems without systemd, "ntp-wait" can be added to the init script and the cron
line preceeding the tuptime execution. 

Try and failure is the best way to find the right solution for the environment in 
which the system is running.

========================
| Date and Epoch notes |
========================

The options --tsince and --tuntil use epoch timestamp format, as quick
reference here are some notes:

Seconds equivalences:
	1 year    31536000 seconds
	1 month    2592000 seconds
	1 week      604800 seconds
	1 day	     86400 seconds
	1 hour        3600 seconds

Convert human date to epoch:
	date --date="JAN-18-2018" +%s
	date --date="20-JAN-18" +%s
	date --date="2018-01-20 16:21:42" +%s
	date --date="2018-01-20 16:21:42 GMT+2" +%s
	date --date="3 week ago" +%s
	date --date="1 year ago" +%s
	date --date="now" +%s

Convert epoch to human date:
	date --date="@1516748400"

===========
| Caveats |
===========

Tuptime can be executed with 'root' user, but it's recommendable the use of an
unprivileged user, like 'tuptime' as the installation section reflects for
avoid security problems. In any case, if the database file is not writable by
the user that execute tuptime, the changes are not saved. This situation is
covered for print values, but not for update database, for that reason, a 
user who can write in the database file must to execute tuptime for update values
at startup and shutdown at least.

Kernel name is registered each time that tuptime update values. If ksplice is
used to update the kernel, last kernel will have the whole time assignment
since the last system start.

Note the filesystem cache on which the files resides for a while before being 
flushing into disk. If things go wrong, like a kernel panic, maybe the last 
updates of the db already written into the file can be lost.

A basic sample web wrapper is available under misc/web/. It is made in php and
can be useful as a starting template to any other particular use case.

If the system have configured a time zone with daylight saving time (DST),
for avoid problems when the time change, the real time clock (RTC) should have
set to universal time coordinated (UTC), not local time. Check it with 
'timedatectl' command.  Reports matching DST changes are completely right.
https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Clock-2.html

The name of the tool is based on the contraction of the words Total Uptime.
